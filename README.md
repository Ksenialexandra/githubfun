Hi!

This public repository contains:

- files added by participants to "Intro to Git(Hub)" workshops, as they practice clone & commit & push steps.

If you are a collaborator to this repository, you might receive email notifications (e.g., for new issues). There are more such emails whenever I give the workshop to a new audience. These are two ways for you to limit the number of notifications you receive:

- removing yourself from this repository: https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/removing-yourself-from-a-collaborators-repository
- configuring watch settings for this repository: https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository
